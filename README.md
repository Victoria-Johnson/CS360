For my project, I have chosen to create Option 1: Inventory App. In this project I designed different screens and functions to produce a user-centered UI for the app. The app would have a Login screen that allowed users to authenticate and access the application with input fields for username/email and password. I also set up functions for new users to register and upon logging in it would direct the users to the next screen which is the Dashboard/Main Menu. The Dashboard/Main Menu provided navigation buttons which allowed users to view, update, and manage inventory items, search and filter options for quick item lookup, and edit functions to update item attributes. SMS notification was also incorporated into the project that notified users of certain data such as low-stock that was either sent via eemail or within the application itself. I designed the appâ€™s architecture using a modular approach. This involved breaking down the app into manageable components and layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access layers. I encountered a lot of errors throughout the project, which resulted me in redesigning my screens and their functionality to reduce redunancies and error reduction.
